The insert (or unshift) function does not scale well in comparison to the append function. As the arrays grow larger, the runtime of the insert function increases at a much more exponential scale than the much more slowly increasing append function. At the scale of a tiny array, the runtime is nearly the same, but by the time we reach an extra large array, insert is over 300 times slower. This is because unshift will shift the position of every single item in the array, every time it is used. Push merely adds to the end of the array.
